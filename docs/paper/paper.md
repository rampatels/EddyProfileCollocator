# Statement of need
- observations of eddies are rare and expensive 
- collocation and excavation offers an opportunity to fill the gap
- need of software because there are inumerable eddies manual tracking will be combursome and arduous
- there are many studies but no software available to do so,
- the approach used in pervious studies is limited to radius of an eddy 
- some studies uses contour to collocate but do not assign the profiles to corresponding eddy limiting the application of the tool
- this software address this gap 
# Summary

# Algorithm
- what are the inputs,
- what are the outputs
- different scenarious such as model outputs/META vs Faghmous tracking etc.
- use your slide from PO meeting and CLEX annual workshop to write this. Also went through the tutorial CS50 to learn about algorithms.
