    "We will begin by loading respective datasets. For the purpose of this tutorial, I have downloaded and prepared `.mat` files, which can be found in the `data` directory. Specifically, I selected an expedition from [GO-SHIP](https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/search?q=GO-SHIP) conducted between Tasmania and Antarctic in 2011. This expedition encountered both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, providing a valuable dataset for our analysis. For mesoscale eddies, I have subsetted eddies from the Faghmous et al. 2015 datasets specifically for the year 2011 which has been updated with closed contours. For details on processing the eddy datasets, please refer to [OceanEddies](https://github.com/rampatels/OceanEddies) and [OceanEddiesToolbox](https://github.com/rampatels/OceanEddiesToolbox)."

    "**NOTE:** The original intent of EddyProfSync is to collocate mesoscale eddies and Argo profiles using the Mesoscale Eddies Trajectory Atlas (META) disseminated by AVISO. Therefore, the nomenclature used in the software follows the META variable name convention. **Users should ensure that their eddy data adheres to the META variable name convention**. In other words, the eddy center x position should be renamed as longitude, and the y position should be renamed as latitude. The contours used to match the profiles surfaced in eddies should have either effective_contour_longitude/latitude or speed_contour_longitude/latitude, depending on the eddy tracking algorithm that you have used for your research.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Faghmous data used here follows Chelton's variable name convention. Additionally, they store the outermost closed contours to define the eddy boundary. This definition of the eddy boundary is similar to META's effective_contour. Nonetheless, I have written a function called `ra_fagwithshape2meta.m`, which can be found in the `utils` directory, that converts this format to the META variable convention. For interested readers, please refer to your GitHub repository of eddy shape."

To index eddies, we use row numbers, as the data is stored in a tabular format where each row corresponds to a distinct eddy realization. For hydrographic observations, the index variable should consist of two columns â€“ the first column representing the voyage name and the second column representing the corresponding stations. These structures allow easy tracing back to the original .nc file if needed. These indices play a crucial role in the collocation process, constituting a unique and integral feature of EddyProfSync."
